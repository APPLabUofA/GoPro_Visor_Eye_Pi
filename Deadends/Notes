Neopixel is incompatible with pygame, due to conflicting control of the BCM chip, which is responsible for the control of GPIO pins

newer versions of psychopy are not compatible with with the pi (only releases from 2015 are working)

There is some market space for a openCV overlay (API) for experimentation on the PI, worth developing a simple library in conjunction with pi 3B+/eeg schematics
